  ## Description
The Weather Dashboard is a full-stack application that allows users to search for the current and future weather outlook for cities around the world using the OpenWeather API. Designed with travelers in mind, the dashboard provides a seamless interface to plan trips based on weather conditions.

The backend fetches and processes weather data from the OpenWeather API, while the front end displays the data in an organized, user-friendly interface. The application also stores search history, allowing users to quickly revisit weather information for previously searched cities.
